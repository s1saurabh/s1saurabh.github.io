## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a Principal Member of Technical Staff with 15+ years of experience designing,
building, and operating reliable infrastructure across public cloud, private cloud,
and on-prem environments.

My work focuses on:
- building boring but dependable systems,
- reducing operational and lifecycle risk,
- improving maintainability and clarity,
- and contributing responsibly to open source within governed ecosystems.

I value long-term stability, clear boundaries, and sustainable engineering practices
over short-term speed or hype.

I believe good software engineering is quiet, predictable, and kind to the people
who will maintain it years later.
